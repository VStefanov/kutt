## Setup

### Manual

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Redis](https://redis.io/) installed.

1. Clone this repository or [download the latest zip](https://github.com/thedevs-network/kutt/releases).
2. Copy `.example.env` to `.env` and fill it properly ([see below](#configuration)).
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Run for development: `npm run dev`.
5. Run for production: `npm run build` then `npm start`.

### Docker

1. Download the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thedevs-network/kutt/develop/docker-compose.yml) and the [`.docker.env`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thedevs-network/kutt/develop/.docker.env) files.
2. Rename `.docker.env` to `.env` and fill it properly ([see below](#configuration)).
3. To execute Kutt you simply have to run `docker-compose up -d` command and then the app should be ready on port "3000".

The `docker-compose.yml` uses the official kutt docker image available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kutt/kutt).

### Configuration

For the minimal configuration the following settings have to be changed in the `.env`-file:

- **DEFAULT_DOMAIN**: The domain of your kutt instance
- **DB_**: The DB credentials (when you use docker-compose you can skip these)
- **ADMIN_EMAILS**: A comma-separated list of the administrator-accounts
- **RECAPTCHA_**: Enter your credentials to use reCaptchas or delete this setting if you don't want to use it
- **MAIL_**: Enter the SMTP-server's credentials (The experience shows SSL works better than STARTTLS; The mail config is required to easily create accounts, see [this comment](https://github.com/thedevs-network/kutt/issues/269#issuecomment-628604256) how it can be done manually)
- **REPORT_EMAIL**: Kutt offers a form to report malicious links which are sent to this mail-address

## Infrastructure

![Diagram](docs/images/mbition-kutt.png)

### Kutt App AWS Architecture Documentation
This architecture supports the Kutt app with high availability, scalability, and security. It includes the following key components:

Architecture Components
- Route 53: Manages DNS routing for the Kutt app. A hosted zone in Route53 allows access to the application at https://dev.mbition-kutt.com/.

- ACM Certificate: Provides and manages SSL/TLS certificates to secure communication between users and the application.

- Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming traffic across ECS tasks to ensure high availability and scalability.

- Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS): Runs containerized applications in a private subnet across two Availability Zones (eu-west-1a and eu-west-1b). ECS ensures that the application is isolated in a secure environment.

- Amazon ElastiCache (Redis): Provides in-memory caching to improve application response times. Redis is hosted in the same private subnet (app subnet) as the ECS tasks, allowing for low-latency access.

- Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL: A managed database that serves as the primary data store for the application. Aurora is deployed in a separate private subnet (db subnet) across two Availability Zones (eu-west-1a and eu-west-1b) to ensure durability and availability.

### Infrastructure Code and Deployment
The Terraform codebase for deploying the infrastructure resides in the `infrastructure` folder at the root level of the repository. The infrastructure is modularized as follows:

- Modules: Each resource (e.g., ECS, Load Balancer, RDS) has a dedicated module under `infrastructure/modules`. These modules are referenced in the main Terraform configuration file (`main.tf`) within the infrastructure folder.

- Helper Scripts: The scripts folder contains scripts to streamline the deployment process. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the main scripts:

    - `pre-deployment-step.sh`: Creates ECR repositories as a prerequisite for deploying ECS tasks. In an automated pipeline, this script would run prior to the Terraform deployment.

    - `ecr-build-and-push.sh`: Builds the Docker image from the app's Dockerfile and pushes it to the ECR repository created in the previous step. This script typically runs between the pre-deployment and Terraform steps.

    - `assume-role.sh`: Assumes the required IAM role to provision Terraform resources, allowing secure and scoped access to AWS.

    - `terraform-<step>.sh`: Helper scripts for each stage of the Terraform deployment process, automating setup and tear-down tasks.
 
_Note: hardcoded some of the variables that are currently not in use in the Dockerfile, if we introduce a full solution and we have an actual values for those variables, then they will be set dynamically during the deployment process._

## Improvements - TO DO

There are couple of things that I was not able to implement:
 - Secrets Manager for Aurora PostgreSQL password - enable Secrets Manager for storing the db password and extend the Kutt application by installing AWS Secrets Manager SDK and fetch the db password directly from Secrets Manager

 - Introduce CI/CD pipeline that has IaC scan tools like Checkov, add steps for linting and formatting, run the `pre-deployment-step.sh`, then build and push the container to ECR and finally deploy infrastructure with the terraform scripts. Add terraform deployment steps for 3 environments - dev, staging and prod.

 - Add a WAF to the Application Load Balancer and setup a few rate-limit rules to now allow too much requests from a single IP.
